    "<p>Thank you so much for contacting me about your project. While it’s true that I’ve worked in several startups and know a lot of really talented software engineers, all of them are currently working. I find that’s true for just about everyone you want – great people find ways to be busy.</p><p>I totally understand that you’re looking for folks to bring on at the ground floor and want my advice on how to find great software engineers (at a low cost). Here’s the thing – doesn’t everyone want great software engineers at a low cost? So I suggest you adjust your pitch. Look for great engineers that want to solve the problem you’re solving. Look for folks who may be busy but are passionate about your space – that may woo them away from their current efforts.</p><p>Anyway, that’s my advice and unfortunately I don’t know of a perfect fit for your project that I could recommend right now.</p><p>Thanks,<br>Chris</p>",
